## Quick Test Sequence
1. **Voice Input** → Upload/record → Process → See extraction
2. **Text Input** → Paste email → Extract → See data
3. **Query** → Type "show all contacts" → See results
4. **Dashboard** → See metrics and tables

## What You Should See
- ✅ Data extracts automatically (no forms!)
- ✅ Dashboard updates in real-time
- ✅ Natural language search works
- ✅ All data visible in tables

## If Something Breaks
- Backend running? → Check http://localhost:8000
- Frontend running? → Check http://localhost:8501  
- Errors? → Check browser console (F12)
