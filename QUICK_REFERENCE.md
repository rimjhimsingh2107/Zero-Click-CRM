## 🚨 Quick Fixes

**Backend won't start**
→ Check `.env` has API keys

**No data visible**
→ `python scripts/setup_demo.py`

**Voice upload slow**
→ First time downloads model (normal)

**Search returns nothing**
→ Make sure demo data loaded

---

## 📞 Q&A Preparation

**"What if AI gets it wrong?"**
"95%+ accuracy. Users can review. Still saves massive time."

**"Does it integrate with Salesforce?"**
"Phase 2. Current version is standalone, but extraction engine works anywhere."

**"How does it scale?"**
"FastAPI backend handles thousands/sec. Supabase scales horizontally."

**"Business model?"**
"$30/user/month. 50-person team = $18K ARR."

**"How long to build?"**
"48 hours for MVP. 2-3 weeks for beta with more features."
